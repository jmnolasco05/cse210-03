# Jumper

Help our jumper to land safely. It's up to you, since you'll have to solve a puzzle or you'll leave him without a parachute. You will have to guess the secret word, indicating the letters that you think make it up. If you make a mistake, you remove part of the parachute from our jumper. The game ends when the secret word is revealed or when our jumper dies.
